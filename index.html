    <h2>History bit</h2>
     <p>Built in AD 122 by order of Emperor Hadrian.  Initially built of stone and turf with milecastles, and turrets spaced along its long 80 Roman miles along the River Tyne to Bowness on Solway.
        There were about 80 milecastles along Hadrian’s Wall, and today we can still see the remains of several of them, though most survive only as earthworks or foundations.
        Best-preserved milecastles you can still visit today are: Milecastle 37 Housesteads (one of the most complete ones), Milecastle 42 Cawfields (great views), Milecastle 48 Poltross Burn,
        Milecastle 39 Castle Nick and Milecastle 33 Coesike.
