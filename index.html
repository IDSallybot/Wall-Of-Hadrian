    <h2>History bit</h2>
     <p>Built in AD 122 by order of Emperor Hadrian.  Initially built of stone and turf with milecastles, and turrets spaced along its long 80 Roman miles along the River Tyne to Bowness on Solway.
        There were about 80 milecastles along Hadrian’s Wall, and today we can still see the remains of several of them, though most survive only as earthworks or foundations.
        Best-preserved milecastles you can still visit today are: Milecastle 37 Housesteads (one of the most complete ones), Milecastle 42 Cawfields (great views), Milecastle 48 Poltross Burn,
        Milecastle 39 Castle Nick and Milecastle 33 Coesike.

     <h2> Walking the Wall: What No One Tells You</h2>
      <p> From aching feet to breathtaking views, walking the 84 mile Hadrian’s Wall Path is a nice challenge and a joy. The middle section is remote and wild — coffee is rare, but the silence is golden...but my eyes still see...
      My goal was to do the walk over 3 days due to other commitments in our busy lives. My plan was to walk 28 miles or 45km per day: Bowness-on-Solway to Steel Rigg, Steel Rigg / Once Brewed to Chollerford and lastly
      Chollerford to Wallsend. This is a very long-distance trek; most walkers split it into 6–8 days.  Unless you arrange a transport between 3 walks to take you to your stop-over point, you need to add the extra miles on.

    <h2> Top Tips for First-Time Walkers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Always have your phone battery charged for emergencies, plus download <a href="https://what3words.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what3words.com</a> app on your mobile device</li>
        <li>Train for consecutive long walks every few days and not just one-offs and you will be well prepared</li>
        <li>Pack light but smart: toiletries including suncream :) , zip-off trousers, convertible jackets, multi-use scarves save space, waterproofs, blister plasters and the rest of the first aid kit just in case</li>
        <li>Choose the footwear that is right for YOU (boots, trainers, bare feet?!)</li>
